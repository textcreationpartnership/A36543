            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106909:80"/> conferring to the remiſſion of our ſins, but among all none more efficatious than from our heart to forgive thoſe who have offended us. Our Saviour Chriſt hanging extended on the Croſs, and having no part of his Sacred body entire from ſtripes and wounds, but onely his bleſſed tongue, made it his firſt care to imploy that member in interceding for thoſe who crucified him in their words and actions; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt potent and prevailing Advocate for his enemies.

In which, deare Lord, if I may expoſtulate thy meaning without preſumption, what unuſuall manner of proceeding is this to award him a juſt triumph, and the reward of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106909:80"/> victory before the fight? hee hath ſcarſely opened his mouth to ſpeake and the heavens are open already; he is not yet departed this life, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee enjoyes thy bleſſed viſion.

He is yet but in the liſts, yet expoſed unto the perill of the fight, yet praying; but his prayer is in behalfe of his enemies. O happy, O potent prayer! Let us now conſider I beſeech you, the reaſon of this his antedated favours and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which without doubt is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that Almighty God is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the rare vertue of ſuch an one who freely remits offences, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly petitions for an enemy, as our moſt gracious Lord even layes his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty aſide, and priviledges his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion ſo highly, as not to ſuffer him to expect his Crowne, till he be ſeated in his Kingly Throne; but hee antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates againſt all former preſident, his felicity, and commands his faireſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, not onely to attend him at his Pallace gates, but even to iſſue forth, and preſent this happy warriour on his

The ſame with al inſtancy of prayer deſired him not to ſhew himſelfe ſo farre a man, as to become a Devill: For his revenge, God would have care to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all for his greater good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to commit it wholly unto him, and even according to true for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude this was the ſufficienteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that he could take, who might aſſure himſelfe that his enemy ſhould never eſcape the divine hands unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The other replyed, Father I am fully reſolved never to pardon him, nor to deſiſt till I have requited him with the like injury. For heavens love, anſwered the holy man, be a man, but ſo as you be a Chriſtian withall, and conſider more what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may perſwade you, than what
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106909:88"/> your violent paſſion may ſuggeſt: Why, ſaid the other, it is no other than reaſon which puts me upon this reſolution, not to ſpare him, who cares not for ſparing any. O but, ſaid <hi>Siſovius,</hi> you cannot determine your owne right your ſelfe, nor execute what you have determined; it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods power to puniſh his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he is the Lord of vengeance, and therefore may freely take revenge; for us we ought not intermeddle in it. Beſides I am ſure you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not only counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but even co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded us to pardon, nay to pray for, to love, and do good unto our enemies. Father, ſayd he, never perſwade me, my heart is a tempeſtuous ſea, &amp; can never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med untill I have taken vengeance of mine enemy.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106909:89"/> them that love you, what thanks is it to you? for ſinners love thoſe who love them: and if you doe good to thoſe, who doe you good, what thanks is it to you? For ſinners alſo doe the like; but doe you love your enemies, and your reward ſhall be much, and you ſhal be Sonnes of the higheſt, becauſe himſelfe is beneficiall to the evill and ungratefull.</hi> This with good reaſon thou doſt enjoyne us, this with great liberality thou doſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe us. But, O deere Lord, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there who will not heare thee? How many that care ſo little for thy Commandement, as their hates and lives have both but one peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od? They proteſt againſt that effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate baſeneſſe, as they title it, to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwaded to put up a wrong. For their parts they ſhould account it their only felicity to repay the injurer in his owne coyn againe: and if <hi>Solomon</hi>-like they might be maſters of their wiſh, a hundred times rather than Wiſedome, they ſhould deſire Revenge. Theſe are they who never ceaſe to importune Almighty God: <hi>Da mihi Domine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micorum meorum animas;</hi> Grant me, O Lord the ſoules of mine enemies; as for the reſt I referre it unto thee. This is the true ſpirit of revenge indeed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to regard the Law of God, nor to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106909:90"/> be terrified with his threats, to bee ſo far from putting up an injury, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it as ſoone as it is offered them, at every light word to vent their cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and when anger hath once ſtirred them up, to follow every impulſe of their enraged minds, ſeeking with all earneſtneſſe their enemies deſtruction. <hi>Haec ulciſcendi libido,</hi> according to <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, negotium curat aut gloriae aut malitiae: ſed gloria ubique vana eſt, &amp; malitia Domino odioſa; hoc quidem loco maxime, quia malum duplicat quod ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel factum eſt.</hi> This luſt of vengeance doth labor either to ſatisfie its malice, or deſire of glory: for glory it is a meere vanity, and malice is an odious thing to Almighty God, eſpecially in theſe circumſtances where of a ſingle offence we make a double one. All the differene betwixt him who provokes unto an injury and him who is provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is onely this, that the one hath his hand firſt in miſchiefe, the other laſt, and both are alike guilty of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God. For he counſailes us, when we are ſtrucken on the one cheek, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to offer the other, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt till we have tyred out our enemies malice with our patience: aſſuring our ſelves that ſo we ſhall annoy him more, than if wee put our ſelves upon
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106909:90"/> our owne defence, ſince he for whoſe ſake we ſuffer all, will for our ſakes chaſtice him with deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Why then ſhould wee arrogate unto our ſelves the right of our defence, which God unto our greater glory hath reſerved unto himſelf? He is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker for our patience; whoſoever truſts him with his wrongs, he will revenge them; with his loſſes he will redreſſe them; with his griefes he will remedy them; finally with his death, and he will reſtore him unto life againe.</p>
